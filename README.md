Remember this command:

```
rclone copy obsidian/summary drive:Obsidian/wkerr-kg/Summary/
```

Next steps:

- [x] We need to take the output of the summary and markdown, write it to file with a reasonable filename based on the title and the contents.
- [x] We need to update the API to make the correct calls.
- [x] We need to add in better error handling.
- [ ] We need to create a view in Obsidian that keeps track of the most recent articles.
- [ ] We need to process PDFs similarly or with some path through paperpile.
- [ ] Website to markdown - stored as part of the knowledge base.
- [ ] PDF to markdown - store as part of the knowledge base and the foundation for the summary.
  - [ ] Compare summaries of the same paper from PDF vs markdown.
